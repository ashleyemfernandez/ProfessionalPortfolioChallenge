        <p>Reviewed source code and ensured there were HTML elements that follow a logical structure
            independent of styling and position. Image elements included alt attributes, heading attributes
            are in sequential order. </p>

        <p>Created HTML and CSS files that include developer's name, recent photo, and links to sections
            about me, my work, and how to contact me. Links in the navigation scroll to the corresponding section. 
            Sections regarding my work include titled images of applications. Hovering over an image makes it larger
            in size than other. Clicking on images leads to deployed application. Layout is responsive and adapts to viewport. </p>

          events within that city. They are provided with the date, time and location of the event as well as an 
          extra feature of pinning the location on the map above the listed events. </p>

            <p>We have designed an app to streamline the purchasing process for bars and bartenders, offering a one-stop 
              platform for their needs. Our aim is to provide easy access to a curated selection of liquors, mixers, 
              and equipment, making shopping convenient and efficient for those in the hospitality industry. This application uses 
              React, Redux, MondoDB, Mongoose ODM, GraphQL, Node.js, Express.js, Stripe, and other technologies.
