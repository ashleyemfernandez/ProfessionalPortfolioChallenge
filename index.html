THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others-->

            <img class="refactorchallenge" alt="refactor challenge screenshot" src="./assets/refactorchallenge.png"></a>
        <p>Reviewed source code and ensured there were HTML elements that follow a logical structure
            independent of styling and position. Image elements included alt attributes, heading attributes
            are in sequential order. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="portfolio-challenge">
        <h3>Portfolio Challenge</h3>
        <a href="https://github.com/ashleyemfernandez/ProfessionalPortfolioChallenge">
        <img class="portfoliochallenge" alt="portfolio challenge screenshot" src="./assets/portfoliochallenge.png"></a>
        <p>Created HTML and CSS files that include developer's name, recent photo, and links to sections
            about me, my work, and how to contact me. Links in the navigation scroll to the corresponding section. 
            Sections regarding my work include titled images of applications. Hovering over an image makes it larger
            in size than other. Clicking on images leads to deployed application. Layout is responsive and adapts to viewport. </p>
